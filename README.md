# GeneralImprovements

Everything is mostly configurable and improves (IMO) several things about the game, with more to come.

### GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
* Vines, ropes, and chains' behaviors may be configured to allow direct climbing while still on them, and to support automatically dismounting at the ends.
* The pre-title screen is skippable. (Configurable)
* The airport lobby is skippable as a "quick start" option when starting a new game, both online and off. (Configurable)
	* You may also specify which ascent to use when quick starting, if any. If left blank, it uses your max unlocked ascent.
* The passport may be brought along to the island. Useful when skipping the airport. (Configurable)
* The fog rising sound effect now plays on subsequent levels, not only on the shore. (Configurable)
* The fog no longer has a wait timer, and only activates from height checks. (Configurable)
* The player no longer gets hungry while near campfires. (Configurable)

### NEW FEATURES:
* TBD

### BUGFIXES:
* Fixes being able to accidentally drop items through terrain.
