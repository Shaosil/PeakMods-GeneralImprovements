Everything is mostly configurable and improves (IMO) several things about the game, with more to come.

### GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:
* The pre-title screen is skippable. (Configurable)
* The fog rising sound effect now plays on subsequent levels, not only on the shore. (Configurable)
* The fog no longer has a wait timer, and only activates from height checks. (Configurable)
* The player no longer gets hungry while near campfires. (Configurable)

### NEW FEATURES:
* TBD

### BUGFIXES:
* Fixes being able to accidentally drop items through terrain.
